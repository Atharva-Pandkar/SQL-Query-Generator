## ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently Not Working (Due to Unicode Issues)

### Bike Model Queries (Known Issue)
10. **"What is the average trip distance for ebikes on weekends?"**
    - Current Issue: Unicode character mismatch in bike model names
    - Workaround: Try "What is the average distance for all weekend trips?"

11. **"How many classic bike trips were there?"**
    - Current Issue: Same Unicode problem
    - Workaround: Try "How many trips were there in total?"

## üîß Technical Details

The main issue is that bike model names in the database use Unicode character U+2011 (non-breaking hyphen) instead of regular ASCII hyphens:
- Database: "E‚ÄëBike" (with U+2011)
- System expects: "E-Bike" (with ASCII hyphen)

## üìä Expected Results Summary

- **Total trips**: 10
- **Stations**: 5 locations  
- **Bike models**: 3 types
- **Date range**: June 2025
- **Congress Avenue average ride time**: 25 minutes
